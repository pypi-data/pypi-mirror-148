# PyHue

[Documentation](https://jkam.notion.site/PyHue-6a7655a97f0249729a5dc729dd801cf0)

Simple but advanced Philips Hue Python3 module!
This project is currently in it's infancy, so do **not** expect anything from this currently. The module currently only auto-discoveres and authenticates to the Philips Hue Bridge!
I will update this file with more information and examples once this can actually do anything that is not the initial talk with the Bridge!
