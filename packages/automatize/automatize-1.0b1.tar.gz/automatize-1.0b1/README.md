# Automatize: Multiple Aspect Trajectory Data Mining Tool Library
---

Welcome to Automatize Framework for Multiple Aspect Trajectory Analysis. You can use it as a web-platform or a Python library.

The present application offers a tool, called AutoMATize, to support the user in the classification task of multiple aspect trajectories, specifically for extracting and visualizing the movelets, the parts of the trajectory that better discriminate a class. The AutoMATize integrates into a unique platform the fragmented approaches available for multiple aspects trajectories and in general for multidimensional sequence classification into a unique web-based and python library system. Offers both movelets visualization and a complete configuration of classification experimental settings.


### *Attention:* this package is being tested and finalized for the second beta version more complete than the previous package:

For now, you can install and use the previous version in:

```bash
    pip install automatise
```
