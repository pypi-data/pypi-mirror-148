## Usage

### Quick start

Let's create a new set to start learning some common Chinese vocabulary. Run
```
quiz sets create
```
```
Title: chinese
Description: Common expressions in Chinese
```
and follow the prompts to give your set a title and a description.

You can see that the newly created set exists by listing all sets via
```
quiz sets list
```
```
TITLE               DESCRIPTION
chinese             Common expressions in Chinese
```

By default, new sets are empty when created. Let's change that by adding some cards. Run
```
quiz set add chinese
```

You'll be prompted to start giving your card a term and a definition.
```
Term: 你好
Definition: Hello
Card added
```

Add as many cards as you want. When you're done, press `ctrl-C` to exit.

To see all the cards you've just added, run
```
quiz set list chinese
```
```
      TERM         DEFINITION
[0]   你好          Hello
[1]   再見          Goodbye
[2]   開心          Happy
[3]   傷心          Sad
[4]   蘋果          Apple
[5]   香蕉          Banana
```

You're all set! To study your new set, run
```
