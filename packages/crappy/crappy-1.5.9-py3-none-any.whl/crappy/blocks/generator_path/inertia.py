      condition (:obj:`str`): Condition to meet to end this path. See

      inertia (:obj:`float`): This is the virtual inertia of the process. The
        higher it is, the slower the `(in/de)` crease will be. In the above
        formula, it is the value of `m`.
      flabel (:obj:`str`): The name of the label of the value to integrate.
      const (:obj:`float`, optional): The value of `K` in the formula above.
        The default value is meant to send `rpm` with inertia in `kg.mÂ²` and
        torque in `N.m`. If sending `rad/s`, use ``const=1``.
      tlabel (:obj:`str`, optional): The name of the label of time for the
        integration.

        Note:
          The data received by ``flabel`` and ``tlabel`` must correspond. In
          other word, there must be exactly the same number of values received
          by these two labels at any instant (i.e. they must come from the same
