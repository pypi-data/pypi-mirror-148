    Args:
      broker (:obj:`bool`, optional): If :obj:`True`, starts the Mosquitto 
        broker during the prepare loop and stops it during the finish loop. If
        Mosquitto is not installed a :exc:`FileNotFoundError` is raised.
      address (optional): The network address on which the MQTT broker is
        running.
      port (:obj:`int`, optional): A network port on which the MQTT broker is
        listening.
      init_output (:obj:`dict`, optional): A :obj:`dict` containing for each
        label in ``topics`` the first value to be sent in the output link. Must
        be given if ``topics`` is not :obj:`None`.
      topics (:obj:`list`, optional): A :obj:`list` of :obj:`str` and/or 
        :obj:`tuple` of :obj:`str`. Each string corresponds to the name of a 
        crappy label to be received from the broker. Each element of the list 
        is considered to be the name of an MQTT topic, to which the client 
        subscribes. After a message has been received on that topic, the block 
        returns for each label in the topic (i.e. each string in the tuple) the 
        corresponding data from the message. It also returns the current
        timestamp in the label `'t(s)'`.
      cmd_labels (:obj:`list`, optional): A :obj:`list` of :obj:`str` and/or 
        :obj:`tuple` of :obj:`str`. Each string corresponds to the name of a 
        crappy label to send to the broker. Each element of the list is 
        considered to be the name of an MQTT topic, in which the client 
        publishes. Grouping labels in a same topic (i.e. strings in a same 
        tuple) allows to keep the synchronization between signals coming from a 
        same block, as they will be published together in a same message. This 
        is mostly useful for sending a signal along with its timeframe.
      labels_to_send (:obj:`list`, optional): A :obj:`list` of :obj:`str` 
        and/or :obj:`tuple` of :obj:`str`. Allows to rename the labels before 
        publishing data. The structure of ``labels_to_send`` should be the 
        exact same as ``cmd_labels``, with each label in ``labels_to_send`` 
        replacing the corresponding one in ``cmd_labels``. This is especially 
        useful for transferring several signals along with their timestamps, as 
        the label ``'t(s)'`` should not appear more than once in the topics 
        list of the receiving block.

    Note:
      - ``broker``:
        In order for the block to run, an MQTT broker must be running at the
        specified address on the specified port. If not, an
        :exc:`ConnectionRefusedError` is raised. The broker can be started and
        stopped manually by the user independently of the execution of crappy.
        It also doesn't need to be Mosquitto, any other MQTT broker can be
        used.

      - ``topics``:
        The presence of the same label in multiple topics will most likely lead 
        to a data loss.

      - ``cmd_labels``:
        It is not possible to group signals coming from different blocks in a
        same topic.

      - ``labels_to_send``:
        Differences in the structure of ``labels_to_send`` and ``cmd_labels``
        will not always raise an error, but may lead to a data loss.

      - **Single-value tuples**:
        Single-value tuples can be shortened as strings.
