# SOMptimised
An optimised version of [sklearn-som](https://pypi.org/project/sklearn-som/) with extended features.

Additional features:

* Can save additional features into the SOM beyond those used to train it
* Can serialise (i.e. save SOM state into a binary file onto the disk)
* Can load back the SOM in its previous state from a binary file on the disk

This SOM implementation has been optimised in terms of speed with respect to [sklearn-som](https://pypi.org/project/sklearn-som/) just by using more efficient numpy functions and features and by reducing the number of loops when possible.

Performance boost does not scale linearly with SOM or dataset size but, as an indication, a 50x50 SOM run on 14 000 data points (1 epoch) takes on my machine:

* **7.3s of CPU and wall time to fit with this library**
* 2min of CPU and wall time to fit with [sklearn-som](https://pypi.org/project/sklearn-som/)

# How to use

Using the SOM is quite straightforward. To do so, data has to be load as a 2D array

```python
import pandas

table      = pandas.read_csv('examples/iris_dataset/iris_dataset.csv')
target     = table['target']
table      = table[['petal length (cm)', 'petal width (cm)', 'sepal length (cm)']]
data       = table.to_numpy()

data_train = data[:-10] # Training set
data_test  = data[-10:] # Test set
```

Training is done with the `fit` method and predictions are done with the `predict` method

```python
from   SOMptimised_dev import SOM, LinearLearningStrategy, ConstantRadiusStrategy, euclidianMetric

# Define SOM parameters
lr     = LinearLearningStrategy(lr=1)
sigma  = ConstantRadiusStrategy(sigma=0.8)
metric = euclidianMetric

nf     = data_train.shape[1] # Number of features
som    = SOM(m=1, n=3, dim=nf, lr=lr, sigma=sigma, metric=metric, max_iter=1e4, random_state=None)
som.fit(data_train, epochs=1, shuffle=True, n_jobs=1)

pred_test = som.predict(data_test)
```

The current state of the SOM can be saved into a binary file and loaded back from it into any python code using the `write` and `read` methods

```
som.write('output_file')

new_som = SOM.read('output_file')
```
