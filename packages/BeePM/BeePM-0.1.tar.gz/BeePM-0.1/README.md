## About
The Bee project brings another copyleft and open-source package manager to GNU/Linux.
This package manager aims to compliment other existing package managers such as `apt`, `dnf`, `portage`, etc. Dependencies are often times installed from your GNU/Linux distribution's repository. 

Currently, using your distribution's repositories is necessary, however, with time  it
will become completely optional, as more and more packages get added to Bee.

### Packages
All official Bee packages are hosted on the [@BeePackages](https://github.com/BeePackages)
GitHub organisation.

### Installation
Simply run the [`Install.sh`](Install.sh) script in order to install the Bee package 
manager across your system.
