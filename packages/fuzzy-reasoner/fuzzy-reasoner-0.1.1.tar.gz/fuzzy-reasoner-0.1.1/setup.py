This restriction should be fixed soon though, as this restriction does limit the usefulness of the library.\n\nThis library is pure Python, and is not highly optimized code. If you need a high-performance mature solver this package is likely not a great fit. However, pull requests are welcome if you\'d like to contribute and help make this library higher-performance!\n\n## Usage\n\nfuzzy-reasoner can be used either as a standard symbolic reasoner, or it can be used with fuzzy unification.\n\nThe setup works similar to prolog, except with python objects representing each component. A simple example of how this works is shown below:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom fuzzy_reasoner import SLDProver, Atom, Rule, Constant, Predicate, Variable\n\nX = Variable("X")\nY = Variable("Y")\nZ = Variable("Z")\n# predicates and constants can be given an embedding array for fuzzy unification\ngrandpa_of = Predicate("grandpa_of", np.array([1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.3, ...]))\ngrandfather_of = Predicate("grandfather_of", np.array([1.01, 0.95, 0.05, 0.33, ...]))\nparent_of = Predicate("parent_of", np.array([ ... ]))\nfather_of = Predicate("father_of", np.array([ ... ]))\nbart = Constant("bart", np.array([ ... ]))\nhomer = Constant("homer", np.array([ ... ]))\nabe = Constant("abe", np.array([ ... ]))\n\nrules = [\n    # base facts\n    Rule(parent_of(homer, bart)),\n    Rule(father_of(abe, homer)),\n    # theorems\n    Rule(grandpa_of(X, Y), (father_of(X, Z), parent_of(Z, Y)))\n]\n\nreasoner = SLDReasoner(rules=rules)\n\n# query the reasoner to find who is bart\'s grandfather\nproof = reasoner.prove(grandfather_of(X, bart))\n\n# even though `grandpa_of` and `grandfather_of` are not identical symbols,\n# their embedding is close enough that the reasoner can still find the answer\nprint(proof.variable_bindings[X]) # abe\n\n# the reasoner will return `None` if the proof could not be solved\nfailed_proof = reasoner.prove(grandfather_of(bart, homer))\nprint(failed_proof) # None\n\n```\n\nIf you don\'t want to use fuzzy unification, you can just not pass in an embedding array when creating a `Predicate` or `Constant`, and the reasoner will just do a plain string equality comparison for unification.\n\n```python\n# constants and predicates can be defined without an embedding array for strict (non-fuzzy) unification\ngrandpa_of = Predicate("grandpa_of")\nbart = Constant("bart")\n```\n\n### Custom matching functions and similarity thresholds\n\nBy default, the reasoner will use cosine similarity for unification. If you\'d like to use a different similarity function, you can pass in a function to the reasoner to perform the similarity calculation however you wish.\n\n```python\n\ndef fancy_similarity(item1, item2):\n    norm = np.linalg.norm(item1.vector) + np.linalg.norm(item2.vector)\n    return np.linalg.norm(item1.vector - item2.vector) / norm\n\nreasoner = SLDReasoner(rules=rules, similarity_func=fancy_similarity)\n```\n\nBy default, there is a minimum similarity threshold of `0.5` for a unification to success. You can customize this as well when creating a `SLDReasoner` instance\n\n```python\nreasoner = SLDReasoner(rules=rules, min_similarity_threshold=0.9)\n```\n\n### Max proof depth\n\nBy default, the SLDReasoner will abort proofs after a depth of 10. You can customize this behavior by passing `max_proof_depth` when creating the reasoner\n\n```python\nreasoner = SLDReasoner(rules=rules, max_proof_depth=10)\n```\n\n## Contributing\n\nContributions are welcome! Please leave an issue in the Github repo if you find any bugs, and open a pull request with and fixes or improvements that you\'d like to contribute.\n\n## Happy solving!\n',
