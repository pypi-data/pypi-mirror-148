# mytorch

## Introduction

This is my python implementation of pytorch.

## Requirements

haven't finished yet!

```bash
pip install Mytorch
```

## Supported part

- torch
- torch.nn

## Usage

mytorch is very similar to pytorch, if you are familar with pytorch, just change `torch` to `Mytorch`, `torch.nn` to `Mytorch.nn` and so on.

see more information in [Documents](https://luzhixing12345.github.io/mytorch/)

## Result

a simple demo using mytorch to do machine learning job GAN

## Conclusion
