# lytorch

## Introduction

This is my python implementation of pytorch.

> Letter `L` comes from my Chinese last name.

## Requirements

haven't finished yet!

```bash
pip install lytorch
```

## Supported part

- lytorch
- lytorch.nn

## Usage

lytorch is very similar to pytorch, if you are familar with pytorch, just change `torch` to `lytorch`, `torch.nn` to `lytorch.nn` and so on.

see more information in [Documents](https://luzhixing12345.github.io/lytorch/)

## Result

a simple demo using lytorch to do machine learning job GAN

## Conclusion
