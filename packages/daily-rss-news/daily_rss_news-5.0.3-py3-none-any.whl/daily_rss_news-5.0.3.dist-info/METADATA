## Caching
Retrieved news are cached. Cache file is in home directory called 'cache.db'.
Caching technique is accomplished via shelve library. To get news from cache internet connection is not required.
Each source is the key of shelve file 'cache.db'. Its value is list of news.

Cache is going to grow in size continuously when you read news from rss sources.
To clear cache type 

### Caching images
Directory named image_cache will be created in user's home directory to store feeds' images
in cache. If feed has image, it will be stored in image_cache directory. When --date option is
available images will be displayed from that directory.  

```shell
$ python -m rss_reader --clear-cache
```

## File converting
Program supports two file converting formats pdf and html. To convert news into file formats,
give either --to-pdf or --to-html and file path where file is created. Give your file path 
relative to your current working directory, like if you are in:

```shell
$ home/user/
```

and giving file path 'custom_dir/file.pdf' will create custom_dir directory if not exists and
saves news into file.pdf.

If file path is not given, it will not convert to given file formats. Instead, just prints news to console 

### Note
Retrieving news from cache without specifying source returns all feeds and their news_list.
In that case, temporary files file_{feed_number}.pdf are created in user's home directory, 
merged into given file path and removed.

While converting to html files, give unique file names. Because it will not override existing files
like pdf, instead it appends news to the end of html file.

## Output colorizing
--colorize option is available to print news in a colored mode. It takes one argument, color, 
and prints news in a given color, default is white. Type -h option to see all available colors

To colorize outputs package named colorama was used, and it is supposed to work well with default 
terminals in Linux and Mac, default cmd in Windows
