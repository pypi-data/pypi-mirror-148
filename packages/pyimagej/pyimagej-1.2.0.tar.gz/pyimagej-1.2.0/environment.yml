# Use this file to construct an environment for working
# with the PyImageJ tutorial notebooks in the doc folder:
#
#   mamba env create
#   conda activate pyimagej
#
# It includes the dependencies needed for using PyImageJ, and for
# executing the Jupyter notebooks in the documentation, but not tools
# for developer-related actions like running automated tests (pytest),
# linting the code (black), and generating the API documentation (sphinx).
# If you want an environment including these tools, use dev-environment.yml.
