# AES-GCM en-/decryption, with AEAD and support for Xpressfeed passwords

This package's aim is to be able to handle general AES-GCM encryption and decryption, while still providing the constants and functionality required to inter-operate with S&P Global's Xpressfeed applications, as they use the same algorithm.

In essence, this package should be capable of producing and reading the same ciphertexts as the Xpressfeed applications.

## Installing

First, ensure you are installing into a virtual environment:

    python3 -m venv venv
    source ./venv/bin/activate
    pip install --upgrade pip

Then use `pip` to install this package and its dependencies:

    pip install -v \
    --upgrade --force-reinstall \
    xf-aes-gcm

There may be more recent, or beta, packages in the Test PyPI repository. To obtain one of these packages add the option

    --extra-index-url https://test.pypi.org/simple/

to the above command.

## Command-line usage

**`xf-aes-gcm`**` [-h|--help] [-v|--version]`

`____________ [-k KEY] [-i IV] [-t TAG_LEN] [-f [F]] [-a AAD]`

`____________ [--no-verify] [{ENC,DEC}]`

Use **`xf-aes-gcm`**` -h` to bring up more details on these options and their default values, as well as several examples of how to use this package.
