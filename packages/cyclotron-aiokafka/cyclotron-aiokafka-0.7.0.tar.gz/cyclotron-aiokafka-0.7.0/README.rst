This is a `Cyclotron <https://github.com/MainRo/cyclotron-py>`_ driver for Kafka
producer and consumers. It is based on `AIOKafka
<https://github.com/aio-libs/aiokafka>`_, and designed specifically for
`makinage <https://github.com/maki-nage/makinage>`_. No doc for now as the code
is still experimental.
