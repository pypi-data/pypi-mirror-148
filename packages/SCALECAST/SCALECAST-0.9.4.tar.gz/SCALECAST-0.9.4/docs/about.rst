About
========
Scalecast is a light-weight modeling procedure and model wrapper meant for those who have at least an intermediate understanding of time series forecasting theory and want to cut the tedious part of data processing, applying autoregression to models, differencing and undifferencing series, and visualizing results, usually on small-to-medium sized datasets (less than 1,000 data points). It can certainly be used for larger, more complex datasets, but if you are looking for a package with more emphasis on deep learning that offers many of the same features as scalecast, `darts <https://unit8co.github.io/darts/>`_ is recommended.

Scalecast provides a Forecaster wrapper around the following estimators: 

* Any regression model from `Sklearn <https://scikit-learn.org/stable/>`_, including Sklearn APIs (like `Xgboost <https://xgboost.readthedocs.io/en/stable/>`_ and `LightGBM <https://lightgbm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_)

* Recurrent neural nets from `Keras TensorFlow <https://keras.io/>`_

* Classic econometric models from `statsmodels <https://www.statsmodels.org/stable/>`_: Holt-Winters Exponential Smoothing and ARIMA

* `Facebook Prophet <https://facebook.github.io/prophet/>`_

* `LinkedIn Silverkite <https://engineering.linkedin.com/blog/2021/greykite--a-flexible--intuitive--and-fast-forecasting-library>`_

* Native combo/ensemble model

The above table might be overly simplistic, but gives an idea of the various ways different models can be specified using scalecast.  

Scalecast offers the following advantages:  

* All models are validated out-of-sample with dynamic multi-step forecasting and this process extends to the future automatically, making implementation of any model on any series fast!

* Most models can be tuned by using a grid search on a validation slice of data.

* The package relies on new object types as little as possible, with only two native classes that each behave logically and with explicit commands. 
  
  * When a list-like object is required in an argument, lists, tuples, arrays, series, or other similar objects are all accepted.
  
  * Calling esitmators or scaling the data requires ``str`` arguments, which the objects know how to parse.

* Many different approaches are available for mixing and matching time series concepts.
