# mokuro

Read Japanese manga with selectable text inside a browser.

**See demo: https://kha-white.github.io/manga-demo**

mokuro is aimed towards Japanese learners, who want to read manga in Japanese with a pop-up dictionary like [Yomichan](https://github.com/FooSoft/yomichan).
It works like this:
1. Perform text detection and OCR for each page.
3. After processing a whole volume, generate a HTML file, which you can open in a browser.
4. All processing is done offline (before reading). You can transfer the resulting HTML file together with manga images to
another device (e.g. your mobile phone) and read there.

mokuro uses [comic-text-detector](https://github.com/dmMaze/comic-text-detector) for text detection
and [manga-ocr](https://github.com/kha-white/manga-ocr) for OCR.
