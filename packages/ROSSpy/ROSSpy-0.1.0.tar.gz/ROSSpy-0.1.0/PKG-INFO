`Reverse Osmosis Scaling Software in Python (ROSSpy) <https://pypi.org/project/ROSSpy/>`_ offers an open-source API to simulate the reactive transport geochemistry of Reverse Osmosis desalination. ROSSpy essentially translates user specifications of an RO system into `PHREEQpy <https://pypi.org/project/phreeqpy/>`_, which is the Python version of `PHREEQC <https://www.usgs.gov/software/phreeqc-version-3>`_. The ``examples/scaling/scaling_validation`` directory of the `ROSSpy GitHub <https://github.com/freiburgermsu/ROSSpy>`_ details the numerous functions and accuracy of ROSSPy via Notebook examples. We encourage users and developers to critique and improve ROSSpy, as an open-source (`MIT License <https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT>`_) library, through `GitHub issues <https://github.com/freiburgermsu/ROSSpy/issues>`_.

The complete documentation is provided by `ReadTheDocs <https://rosspy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html>`_.
