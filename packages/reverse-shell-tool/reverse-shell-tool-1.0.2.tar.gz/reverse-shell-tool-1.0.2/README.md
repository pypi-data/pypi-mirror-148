## Description 

Reverse Shell Tool by Mustansir Godhrawala. I created this tool to make the reverse shell process easier, rather than having to open pentest monkey's reverse shell cheatsheet and editing out the IP and PORT, the script will choose a random port and grab your IP and put it into your clipboard. 

Heck we're even giving you options for listeners, you can use netcat or pwncat by Caleb Stewart and John Hammond for better post exploitation. 

We'll create the payload and put it in your clipboard, and start the listener on our own too. All so you can spend your time pentesting rather than having to type quad 4 or 1234 again and again. 

### **Run as sudo only.**
