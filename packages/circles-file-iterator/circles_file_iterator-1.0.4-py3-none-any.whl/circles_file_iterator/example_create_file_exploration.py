         Making and using custom file share explorations
--------------------------------------------------------------
This example file shows how to create a nexw file share exploration
file.

Those files are useful in different situation:
- You want to have a list of files that you will be working on
    repeatedly and you have specific requirements regarding the
    root, the kind of folder to look at, etc
- You want to reference files as in the default but new data needs
    to be added.
- You want to reference different kind of files.

After showing this, this files shows how to use those user-specific
explorations to iterate on them.

NOTE: Be sure to have configured your cache and your irods environment before 
testing these functionnalities. You can do so by using the file 'example_configuration.py's

# ------------------ creating the async loop ------------------
'''
    -> AN IMPORTANT NOTE ON THE ASYNCHRONOUS BEHAVIOR:

we have to create an async loop and wait for its completion to be able to perform
an 'await' in the python script. See the link below for more information:
https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio-eventloop.html#running-and-stopping-the-loop
https://stackabuse.com/python-async-await-tutorial/, section 'Running the Event Loop'

In a server environment, you can just use those Get/Put inside of async functions, using await to wait
for their completion. You can see an example below

async def some_function():
    ....
    await IRODSGet(remote, local)
    ....

loop = asyncio.get_event_loop()


# ======================= MAKING A NEW FILE SHARE EXPLORATION =======================
'''
Here, we show how to run an exploration for CSV CAN+GPS coupled files.
It mostly relies on calling the async function "create_fileshare_exploration".
'''
print('\n------------------------ MAKING A NEW FILE SHARE EXPLORATION ------------------------\n')

root = '/iplant/home/sprinkjm/publishable-circles/2T3Y1RFV8KC014025/libpanda/2021_01_16/'

print(f'\nStarting file share exploration at root {root}')
remote_file_name = loop.run_until_complete(create_fileshare_exploration_can_gps(root, exploration_name, verbose=True))
print(f'It has been uploaded to {remote_file_name}')


# ======================= ITERATING OVER USER DEFINED EXPLORATION =======================
'''
Now that we have created an custom exploration, let's see how to use it within a
FileIterator object.

We can check which user explorations has been done on CyVerse, then set the exploration
to the one we did, then download locally this user exploration.
