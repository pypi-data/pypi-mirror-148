"""
Enumerate all based covering spaces with bounded degree of a finite Cayley
complex such that the basepoint has minimal complexity.

The algorithm used here is the one presented in "Computations with Finitely
Presented Groups" by Charles Sims, stripped of all of the irrelevant machinery
and viewed in the more natural context of covering spaces.

Conventions:

- A finite Cayley complex is a 2-complex with 1 vertex, G edges and finitely
  many 2-cells.  Each edge is directed and labeled with a positive integer.  The
  attaching maps of the 2-cells are represented by cyclically reduced words in
  the edge labels and their negations.  A negative label indicates that the edge
  is traversed opposite to the edge's direction.  These cyclically reduced words
  are called relations.

- The vertices of a degree D finite cover of a Cayley complex are indexed as
  1, ..., D. The base point is the vertex with index 1.

- The number R of edge labels is called the rank in the code. That refers to the
  rank of the free group that would be used in the group presentation associated
  with the Cayley complex.  Note that when a word is specified the rank must
  also be specified, since the word is being viewed as representing an element
  of a specific free group.

- The 1-skeleton of a cover of a finite Cayley complex is a labeled directed
  graph in which each vertex has G outgoing edges and G incoming edges, one for
  each label.  If the cover has degree D then it can be described with a DxG
  matrix in which the (i, j) entry is the index of the terminal vertex of the
  edge with initial vertex i and label j.  This is the outgoing matrix.
  A related DxG matrix, the incoming matrix, is the one for which the (i,j)
  entry is the index of the initial vertex of the edge with terminal vertex i
  and label j.  For efficiency we use and maintain both of these, even though
  they carry the same information. All entries of these matrices will be
  non-zero in a complete covering graph.

- While constructing covers we need to work with subgraphs of the 1-skeletion.
  A subgraph can be represented by a DxG matrix in which some of the entries are
  0.  The (i,j) entry of the outgoing matrix is 0 if and only if there is no
  edge with initial vertex i and label j in the subgraph.  Similarly, the (i,j)
  entry of the incoming matrix is 0 if and only if there is no edge with
  terminal vertex i and label j.

        Return False if the subgraph can provably not be extended to a cover
        which is minimal in its conjugacy class, True otherwise.

        The ordering of based coverings is given as follows.  Given a covering
        with rank R and degree D, consider all pairs (N, L) where N is a vertex
        index in [1, D] and L is a signed label in [-R, -1] or [1, R].  Order
        the signed labels as 1, -1, 2, -2, ..., R, -R.  Use that to lex order
        the 2*D*R pairs (N, L).  For each pair (N, L) assign an edge E(N, L) and
        a number s(N, L) as follows:

            * if L > 0, E(N, L) is the edge with initial vertex N and
              label L and s(N, L) is index of its terminal vertex.

            * if L < 0, E(N, L) is the edge with terminal vertex N and
              label -L and s(N, L) is the index of its initial vertex.

        The list [s(N, L) for all (N, L)] is the complexity of the covering;
        complexities are ordered lexicographically.

        Any conjugate of the subgroup corresponding to a covering graph can be
        obtained by changing the basepoint.  A choice of basepoint determines an
        indexing of the vertices where the index of a vertex v is the next
        available index at the moment when the first E(N, L) having v as its
        terminal (initial) vertex if L > 0 (L < 0) is added.  We only enumerate
        based coverings for which the basepoint is chosen to minimize
        complexity.  The subgroups corresponding to these coverings will then by
        unique up to conjugacy.

        Even when working with a proper subgraph of a covering graph (containing
        the basepoint) it may be possible to deduce that the subgraph cannot be
        extended to a minimal covering.  In such a case the subgraph should not
        be added to the Sims tree.  If this test is done at each stage of the
        construction of the tree, the complete graphs in the final tree will
        automatically be minimal.

        This method iterates through all vertices of the subgraph, constructing
        as much as possible of the vertex ordering determined by taking that
        vertex as a basepoint.  It returns False as soon as it encounters an
        edge which would result in a higher complexity. If no such edge is found
        for any choice of basepoint it returns True.

    A "tree" of SimsNodes constructed by Sims algorithm.  Each
    SimsNode in the tree is constructed by adding edges to its parent in
    such a way that every relation that can be lifted lifts to a loop.  (It is
    allowed for a relation to fail to lift because an edge is missing from the
    subgraph.)

    Implementation note: The collection of all graphs produced by Sims algorithm
    can be viewed as a tree, where the children of a node are obtained by adding
    one edge at the first empty slot.  However, only the tips of the tree are of
    interest.  So we can implement the "tree" as a python list.  Each pass
    through the loop in the (currently unused) bloom method generates a new list
    by replacing each subgraph by a list of subgraphs obtained by adding edges.
    This turns out to be very memory intensive, since these lists grow very
    large before finally collapsing at the end of the computation.  We also
    provide an iterator which iterates through the tips of the tree while using
    a constant amount of memory.  The depth of the tree is bounded by the number
    of edges in a cover of the maximal allowed degree.  Traversal of the tree in
    depth-first order only requires a stack of size equal to the maximum depth.
