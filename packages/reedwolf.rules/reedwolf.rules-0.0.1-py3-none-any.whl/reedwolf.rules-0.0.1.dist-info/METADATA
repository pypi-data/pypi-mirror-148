# reedwolf.rules project
Reedwolf.rules is a [Python](https://www.python.org/) library that extends
and enrich existing structured and unstructured data model with declarative
constraints and automatic evaluation logic.

Some basic example in
[test_basic.py](https://github.com/trebor74hr/reedwolf.rules/blob/main/tests/test_basic.py).

**This is currently unfinished project.** First feature complete and stable
release will include verbose explanation and documentation with examples.

Reedwolf.rules is first published part of larger **Reedwolf** project which
aims solving common software design tasks in more-or-less unique way.
