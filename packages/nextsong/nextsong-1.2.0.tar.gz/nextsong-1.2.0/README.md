`nextsong` is a library and command line executable to support creating media playlists with a complex nested structure.

_Note: This project is theoretically platform agnostic, but isn't tested outside of Linux. If you encounter a problem using it on another platform please feel free to open an issue._

# Features

- Recursive tree-based structure, where each item in the playlist is itself a playlist with various options for sampling songs
- XML format to save and load playlists
- Command-line executable to get the next song in the playlist
- [ezstream](https://icecast.org/ezstream/) integration

# Usage

## Basic example

First create a playlist and save it to an XML file:

```python
from nextsong import Playlist

Playlist(
    "my_favorite_song.mp3",
    "artist1/album1/*.mp3",
    loop=True,
).save_xml()
```

Each item the playlist can be a filepath, a [glob pattern](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pathlib.html#pathlib.Path.glob), or another playlist.

This creates a file named `nextsong.xml` describing the playlist:

```xml
<nextsong>
  <meta/>
  <playlist loop="true">
    <path>my_favorite_song.mp3</path>
    <path>artist1/album1/*.mp3</path>
  </playlist>
</nextsong>
```

After creating the XML file, invoke `nextsong` from the command line to get the next track in the playlist

```sh
$ nextsong
/home/myusername/media/music/my_favorite_song.mp3
$ nextsong
/home/myusername/media/music/artist1/album1/01_hello_world.mp3
$ nextsong
/home/myusername/media/music/artist1/album1/02_foobar.mp3
```

The `nextsong` command will print the absolute path of the next track to standard output or print an empty line once the end of the playlist has been reached. In this example, the playlist is set to loop, so it will never end. The state of iteration through the playlist is maintained in a pickle file named `state.pickle`. Note that changes to the playlist XML file will only take effect by deleting this pickle file.

The filepaths in this example and other options such as the root media directory can be configured within the Python script or via environment variables.

## Ezstream integration

First create the playlist XML file using this package as described above.

To update the `ezstream` XML file see the `ezstream` man page for the most fleshed out and up to date details. You need to create a `program` intake that runs `nextsong`. Overall your `intakes` element should look something like this:

```xml
<intakes>
  <intake>
    <type>program</type>
    <filename>nextsong</filename>
  </intake>
</instakes>
```

When running `nextsong` through `ezstream` you can use environment variables to adjust the configuration. For example, to set `nextsong`'s `media_root` config, run `ezstream` with `NEXTSONG_MEDIA_ROOT` set to the desired value

```sh
$ NEXTSONG_MEDIA_ROOT=~/music ezstream -c ~/ezstream.xml
```

Details on config values and their corresponding environment variables can be found in the `nextsong.config` docstring, which can be viewed in the Python interpreter by calling `help(nextsong.config)`.

## Local playback example with vlc

While actually playing the media is outside this library's scope, it's fairly straightforward to write a script that does media playback by invoking `nextsong` in a loop and feeding the result into a media player. For example, here's a bash script using vlc to play the playlist:

```bash
trap break INT
while true
do
    TRACK="$(nextsong)"
    if [ -z "$TRACK" ]
    then
        printf "End of playlist\n"
        break
    fi
    printf "Playing %s\n" "$TRACK"
    cvlc --play-and-exit "$TRACK" >& /dev/null
done
```

## Learning more

Any module, class, or function can be passed into the builtin `help` function for detailed information. See `tests/cases/examples` for complete usage examples. For help on the command line tool, invoke

```sh
$ nextsong --help
```
