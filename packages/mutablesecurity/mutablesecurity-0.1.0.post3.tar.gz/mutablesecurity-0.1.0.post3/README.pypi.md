# Background 👴🏼

In today's fast-paced society, most people are unaware of the potential consequences of cyberattacks on their organizations. Furthermore, they do not invest in cybersecurity solutions due to the costs of setup, licensing, and maintenance.

# Vision 📜

**MutableSecurity** 🏗️ is a solution for making cybersecurity solution management easier and more accessible, from deployment and configuration to monitoring.

Despite the current lack of complex functionalities, we have a vision in mind that we hope to achieve in the near future. As we must begin somewhere, the first step in our progress is this command line interface for automatic management of cybersecurity solutions.

Come join the MutableSecurity journey!
