# py-build-cmake

Modern, [PEP 517](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0517/) compliant build
backend for building Python packages with extensions built using CMake.

## Features

 - Build C, C++ or Fortran extension modules for Python using CMake
 - Declarative configuration using `pyproject.toml` ([PEP 621](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0621/)), compatible with
   [flit](https://github.com/pypa/flit)
 - Editable/development installations for Python modules ([PEP 660](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0660/))
 - Compatible with [pybind11](https://github.com/pybind/pybind11)
 - Generate stubs for type checking and autocompletion
 - Customizable CMake configuration, build and installation options
 - Support for multiple installation configurations and components
 - Cross-compilation support
 - No dependency on [setuptools](https://github.com/pypa/setuptools)

## Installation

The py-build-cmake package is available on
[PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/py-build-cmake/):

```sh
pip install py-build-cmake
```

## Documentation

The documentation can be found on <https://tttapa.github.io/py-build-cmake>.

The format of the configuration file is explained in 
[Config.md](https://tttapa.github.io/py-build-cmake/Config.html).

Alternatively, use the following command to get the documentation for all
supported options:
```sh
python -m py_build_cmake.help
```

## Usage

If you don't have one already, add a `pyproject.toml` configuration file to your
project's repository. Specify the metadata required by [PEP 621](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0621/),
and tell py-build-cmake how to build your project. For example:

```toml
[project] # Project metadata
name = "example-project"
readme = "README.md"
requires-python = ">=3.8"
license = { "file" = "LICENSE" }
authors = [{ "name" = "Pieter P", "email" = "pieter.p.dev@outlook.com" }]
keywords = ["some", "keywords"]
classifiers = ["Topic :: Scientific/Engineering"]
urls = { "Documentation" = "https://tttapa.github.io/py-build-cmake" }
dependencies = ["numpy"]
dynamic = ["version", "description"]

[build-system] # How pip and other frontends should build this project
requires = ["py-build-cmake", "mypy"]
build-backend = "py_build_cmake.build"

[tool.py-build-cmake.module] # Where to find the Python module to package
directory = "src-python"

[tool.py-build-cmake.sdist] # What to include in source distributions
include = ["CMakeLists.txt", "src/*"]

[tool.py-build-cmake.cmake] # How to build the CMake project
build_type = "RelWithDebInfo"
source_path = "src"
build_args = ["-j"]
install_components = ["python_modules"]

[tool.py-build-cmake.stubgen] # Whether and how to generate typed stub files
```
The README of [`examples/minimal`](https://github.com/tttapa/py-build-cmake/tree/main/examples/minimal)
describes this configuration file in much more detail.

Then use [`pip`](https://github.com/pypa/pip), [`build`](https://github.com/pypa/build)
or another PEP 517 compatible frontend to install and/or build the package.

Build sdist and wheel packages you can upload to PyPI:
```sh
python -m build . # find the sdist and wheel file in the 'dist' folder
```

Install the package in the current environment:
```sh
pip install .    # normal installation
pip install -e . # editable installation
```

## Examples

For example usage, see the [`examples/minimal`](https://github.com/tttapa/py-build-cmake/tree/main/examples/minimal)
and [`examples/pybind11-project`](https://github.com/tttapa/py-build-cmake/tree/main/examples/pybind11-project)
example projects.
