Description: 
        
        
            Realmz
            
            This is a very small module built for a private project. Should you want to do more than the basis functionalities 
            supported by this package, then you are looking on the wrong place. A service component that will send birthday 
            wishes to employees. The service extracts a list of employees whose birthdays occur today using the Realm Digital 
            Employee API and create a generic message E.g. “Happy Birthday {name 1}, {name 2}” and send the message to an 
            email address configured for the component. https://interview-assessment-1.realmdigital.co.za/
            
            Example:
            
                from realmz import main as realmz_main
                
                def test():
                    realmz.start_wish()
                    
                test()
                                
            You'd input the database full path in case you'd like to save data to a database instead of a json file.
            Please note that we currently only support sqlite.
            
            When prompted with options:
                1. Birthday
                2. Anniversary
                
            This package uses 'https://pypi.org/project/python-dotenv/' to handle .env variable for this project.
            
            This package uses 'https://pypi.org/project/schedule/' to schedule the app, when and how it would run.
