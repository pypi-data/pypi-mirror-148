Copy database files into an in-memory database on startup

This plugin is **highly experimental**. It currently exists to support Datasette performance research, and is not designed for actual production usage.

## Installation

Install this plugin in the same environment as Datasette.

    datasette install datasette-copy-to-memory

## Usage

On startup, Datasette will create an in-memory named database for each attached database. This database will have the same name but with `_memory` at the end.

So running this:

    datasette fixtures.db

Will serve two databases: the original at `/fixtures` and the in-memory copy at `/fixtures_memory`.

## Development

To set up this plugin locally, first checkout the code. Then create a new virtual environment:

    cd datasette-copy-to-memory
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate

Now install the dependencies and test dependencies:

    pip install -e '.[test]'

To run the tests:

    pytest
