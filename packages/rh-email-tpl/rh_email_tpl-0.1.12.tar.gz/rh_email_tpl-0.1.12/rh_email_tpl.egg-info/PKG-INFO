## Making a new release

## This project uses Black

We use the python [Black](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) code formatter.

If you would like to format code directly in your IDE, take a look [here](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/editor_integration.html). This is possible in PyCharm, Sublime Text, VSCode ...

To ensure that your push will not be rejected, make sure to install [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/#install) on your machine.
Then inside the project folder run the following:
```sh
pre-commit install
```

This will install the required pre-commit hooks that will run everytime you will commit something.
For more details you can check the `.pre-commit-config.yaml` file
