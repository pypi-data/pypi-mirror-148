# Alarm.com Python Library

**Author: Justin Wong**

## Overview

A Python library to asynchronously interface with Alarm.com.
Forked from Daren Lord's pyalarmdotcom. Mainly built for use with Home Assistant.

## BREAKING CHANGES

v0.2 of pyalarmdotcomajax breaks just about all features available in v0.1. Be careful when updating.

## Installation / Usage

To install use pip:

```bash
pip install pyalarmdotcomajax
```

Or clone the repo:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/uvjustin/pyalarmdotcomajax.git
python setup.py install
```

## Usage

See `examples/basic_sensor_data.py` for a basic usage example.

## Device Support

- As of v0.2, multiples of all devices are supported.
- All devices include the attributes: `name`, `id_`, `state`, `battery_low`, `battery_critical`, `malfunctioning`, `parent_ids`, and a few others.

| Device Type  | Notable Attributes                  | Actions                               |
| ------------ | ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| System       | `unit_id`                           | (none)                                |
| Partition    | `uncleared_issues`, `desired_state` | arm away, arm stay, arm night, disarm |
| Sensor       | `device_subtype`                    | (none)                                |
| Locks        | `desired_state`                     | lock, unlock                          |
| Garage Door  | (none)                              | open, close                           |
| Image Sensor | `images`                            | peek_in                               |
| Light        | `brightness`                        | turn_on (with brightness), turn_off   |

## Command Line Interface

The CLI is available by running `adc` from anywhere in your terminal.

```bash
usage: adc [-h] -u USERNAME -p PASSWORD [-c COOKIE] [-v] [-x] [-o ONE_TIME_PASSWORD] [-n DEVICE_NAME] [-d] [-ver]

Basic command line debug interface for Alarm.com via pyalarmdotcomajax. Shows device states in various formats.

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -u USERNAME, --username USERNAME
                        alarm.com username
  -p PASSWORD, --password PASSWORD
                        alarm.com password
  -c COOKIE, --cookie COOKIE
                        two-factor authentication cookie. cannot be used with --one-time-password!
  -v, --verbose         show verbose output. -v returns server response for all devices except systems. -vv returns server response for all devices.
  -x, --include-unsupported
                        when used with -v, returns data for cameras, lights, and thermostats.
  -o ONE_TIME_PASSWORD, --one-time-password ONE_TIME_PASSWORD
                        provide otp code for accounts that have two-factor authentication enabled. cannot be used with --cookie!
  -n DEVICE_NAME, --device-name DEVICE_NAME
                        registers a device with this name on alarm.com and requests the two-factor authentication cookie for this device.
  -d, --debug           show pyalarmdotcomajax's debug output.
  -ver, --version       show program's version number and exit
```

## Development

### VS Code Support Structures

This repository includes a full development environment for VS Code:

1. VS Code [dev container](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/create-dev-container). Automatically installs extensions and Python dependencies and registers Git pre-commit scripts.
2. Configuration files for type checking ([mypy](http://mypy-lang.org/)), linting ([flake8](https://flake8.pycqa.org/en/latest/), [isort](https://github.com/PyCQA/isort), and [black](https://github.com/psf/black)), code security ([Bandit](https://bandit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)), etc.
3. Pre-commit checks run all of the above when committing to Git and on demand via VS Code [tasks](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/tasks).

### References

1. Some API definitions are available in the [node-alarm-dot-com repository](https://github.com/node-alarm-dot-com/node-alarm-dot-com/tree/master/src/_models).

### Open Items

#### Features

1. Support additional components (lights, irrigation, etc.).
2. Support more sensor types (see list above in this README).
3. Add `debug_info` property to `ADCController` that returns aggregate of raw JSON from all endpoints. This will allow users to export the entity model of unsupported devices to help maintainers implement support in this library.
4. Similar to above, proactively populate `unsupported_devices` property for `ADCBaseElement` to show users device id, device name, and device type for available but unsupported devices.
5. More granular exception handling when logging in. Should report discrete error types for authentication failures due to wrong credentials, connection issues, or other.

#### Housekeeping

1. Testing framework
