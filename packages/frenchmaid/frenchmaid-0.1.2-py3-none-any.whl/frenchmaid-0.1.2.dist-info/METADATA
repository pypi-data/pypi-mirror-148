# French Maid v0.1.2

Are you a python developer who also/only uses windows and are sick are tired of constantly deteting those pesky `__pycache__` directories? Fear not, **frenchmaid** is here to help! frenchmaid is a CLI tool written in pure python that will search your entire project directory and delete any `__pycache__` folders (and the files within) in your root directory.

## Installation

    pip install frenchmaid

or

    pip3 install frenchmaid

<details>
<summary>Windows 10 PATH Error</summary>

If you encounter a path error on your CMD after running one of the commands above (e.g one about not finding a frenchmaid.exe or the frenchmaid.exe not being on PATH), carry out the following steps:

1.  Uninstall frenchmaid

        pip uninstall frenchmaid

2.  Open a new terminal as admin

    1. Open the start menu (press the windows button)
    2. Search for CMD
    3. Right click and select run as administrator

3.  Install frenchmaid globally

        pip install frenchmaid

Remember not to use the `--user` flag unless you have set this option on path as well.

 </details>

## Update

    pip install --upgrade frenchmaid

or

    pip3 install --upgrade frenchmaid

## Usage

In any terminal window:

_Linux based machines:_

    <user>@<machine>:~/Documents/example-app$ frenchmaid clean

_Windows based machines:_

    C:\Users\<user>\Documents\example-app> frenchmaid clean

<br>
It's really that simple, just ensure that you are in you project's root directory! For clarity, the above example assumes that your project structure is something like this for example:
<br><br>

    example-app/
    |________ main.py
    |________ requirements.txt
    |________ src/
             |_________ __init__.py
             |_________ app.py

If the root is `example-app` then you can see that the terminal should be in that folder.

#### Version

## Support and Reporting

You can report any bugs or improvements [here](https://github.com/lewisjr/home-app/issues), I will try to address them as soon as possible. Feel free to suggest any other files or folders you think it should delete (e.g .pytest_cache) with all context on how they appear. I will happily make it a possiblity without breaking the current format! To the best of my abilites of course, and the github page will be updated on any changes.
