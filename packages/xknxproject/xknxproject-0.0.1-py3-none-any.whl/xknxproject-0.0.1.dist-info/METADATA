Extracts KNX projects and parses the underlying XML.

This project aims to provide a library that can be used to extract and parse KNX project files and read out useful information including
the group addresses, devices and their descriptions and possibly more.

Note: The specified KNX project file will be extracted to /tmp during the process. Once parsing is done all files will be deleted from /tmp again.

## Documentation

Currently, xknxproject supports extracting (password protected) ETS5 and ETS6 files and can obtain the following information from your project:

* Areas, Lines, Devices and their individual address
* CommunicationObjectInstance references for their devices (GA assignments)
* Group Addresses and their DPT type if set

Installation:

    pip install xknxproject

Usage:

    from xknxproject import KNXProj


    def main():
        """Extract and parse a KNX project file."""
        knxproj: KNXProj = KNXProj("path/to/your/file.knxproj", "optional_password")
        areas, group_addresses = knxproj.parse()
