"""View of Hypergraphs as a subhypergraph or read-only.

In some algorithms it is convenient to temporarily morph
a hypergraph to exclude some nodes or edges. It should be better
to do that via a view than to remove and then re-add. This module provides those graph views.

The resulting views are essentially read-only graphs that
report data from the original graph object. 

Note: Since hypergraphviews look like hypergraphs, one can end up with
view-of-view-of-view chains. Be careful with chains because
they become very slow with about 15 nested views. Often it is easiest to use .copy() to avoid chains.

    `subhypergraph_view` provides a read-only view of the induced subhypergraph that
    includes nodes, edges, or both based on what the user specifies. This function
    automatically filters out edges that are not subsets of the nodes. This function
    may create isolated nodes.

    If the user only specifies the nodes to include, the function returns
    an induced subhypergraph on the nodes.

    If the user only specifies the edges to include, the function returns all of the nodes
    and the specified edges.

    If the user specifies both nodes and edges to include in the subhypergraph, then the
    function returns a subhypergraph with the specified nodes and edges from the list of specified
    hyperedges that are induced by the specified nodes.

    Parameters
    ----------
    H : hypergraph.Hypergraph
        A hypergraph
    filtered_nodes : list or set, default: None
        A list of the nodes desired for the subhypergraph.

    filtered_edges : list or set, default: None
        A list of the edges desired for the subhypergraph.
        If None, uses all the edges.
