```bash
pip install hurocon
```

Or directly from this Github repo:

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/maximilionus/hurocon.git
```

## Quickstart
### Intro
After successful [installation](#installation) of this tool it can be accessed in shell using the following commands:

```bash
$ hurocon
# OR
$ python -m hurocon
```

You can also view a list of all root commands with:
```bash
$ hurocon --help
```

Each command in this tool has a special `--help` flag to display detailed information about it

### Authentification
First of all, you need to specify the authorization and connection data so that this tool can access the router in the future. You do it in two ways.

- In interactive mode:
  ``` bash
  $ hurocon auth login
  ```

- Manually, by running:
  ```bash
  # Initialize local configuration file
  $ hurocon config init

  # Show path to local configuration file
  $ hurocon config path
  ```

  And then manually editing the `json` file with any text editor. It has a human-readable structure, so every part of it is exactly what you think it is.

### Testing Connection
After auth details successfully specified you can test your connection with router by running

```bash
$ hurocon auth test

# Returns
# Success: Successful Authentification
# Failure: Auth failed, reason: "..."
```

### Conclusion
That's it, you're ready to go. And remember - no matter how deep you go, `--help` flag is always here to help üëç
