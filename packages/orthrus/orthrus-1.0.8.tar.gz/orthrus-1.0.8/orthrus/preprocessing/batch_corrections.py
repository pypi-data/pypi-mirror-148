        A pure numpy implementation of the code found at:

        https://github.com/chichaumiau/removeBatcheffect/blob/master/limma.py

        based on our weak understanding of what the patsy package does and
        following along with the example in the link above. Their data comes from

        https://github.com/brentp/combat.py

        Note that we don't have the capability to include an assumed model effect
        in the covariance_matrix as in Chichau's version, but our approach is
        only to remove batch factors, then apply machine learning algo's to the
        result. Making an initial assumption of a linear model in the phenotypes in
        preprocessing stage may not be appropriate depending on the machine learning
        tools used later in the pipeline.
