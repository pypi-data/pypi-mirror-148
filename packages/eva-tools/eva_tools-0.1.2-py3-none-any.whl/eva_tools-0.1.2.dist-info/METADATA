The eva_tools package is set of tools used for research on stratospheric aerosol data sets. In particular, the package
was created to aid in the development of the Easy Volcanic Aerosol model (EVA).

This package was created by C.J. Ogilvie under the supervision of Dr. Matthew Toohey, for the Institute of Space and
Atmospheric Studies at the University of Saskatchewan.

    - C.J. Ogilvie: cfo188@usask.ca
    - Dr. Matthew Toohey: matthew.toohey@usask.ca

The package contains four tools. These are:
    - read_eva: Reads stratospheric aerosol files into python-usable data.
    - write_eva: Writes stratospheric aerosol data into files (netCDF4 and Excel files currently supported).
    - plot_eva: Quickly generate data plots from stratospheric aerosol files.
    - merge_eva: Concatenates two or more stratospheric aerosol files to cover a larger time period.
