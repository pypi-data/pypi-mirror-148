A better Statcord API library for Python + Discord.py (and maybe its forks)

## Advantages
- **It's blazin fast**: The official library is full of inefficient, slow, and unnecessary code which does nothing **except slow your bot down**.
- **Cleaner and smaller codebase**: BetterStatcord.py is smaller and cleaner, making it much more reliable and understandable.
- **Easier to use**: For its basic functionality, all you need is **one** line of code to set it up!
- **More accurate**: This library has more accurate statistics than the official one.
- **Supports clustering**: This library has a special class for clustered bots, which supports the clustered API stats endpoint.
- **Supports Discord.py forks**: The main library does not...
- **Supports Disnake + Pycord slash commands**: Supports slash commands for both of these forks.
