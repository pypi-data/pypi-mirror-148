    Can add further stats based ROI selection to optimize -
                - not requiring continuous track, but ROIs will be continuous and used for peak detection 



    Local maxima is used in find_peak, but prominence and cSelectivity are used to control detection,
    in step-wise optimization. 
    Peak shape (Gaussian fitting goodness > 0.8) is required for noisy data or iterated detection.
    Noisy tracks are smoothed using moving average of 3 data points.
    peak area is integrated by summing up intensities of included scans.
    Reported left/right bases are not based on Gaussian shape or similar, just local maxima.
    Noise level is defined as mean of all non-peak, nonzero data points.

    Iterations are only done when good peaks are detected in the first round, 
    to ensure no small peaks are skipped due to prominence control in round 1,
    by removing round 1 peaks from the track in the next peak detection.
    Iterations are not performed on noisy data tracks.

    Input
    =====
    mass_track: {'id_number': k, 'mz': mz, 'rt_scan_numbers': [..], 'intensity': [..]}
                Mass tracks are expected to be continuous per m/z value, with 0s for gaps.
    iteration:  Second iteration of peak detection; done on remaining data points.
                The 2nd iteration may catch small peaks overshadowed by big ones. No clear need to go over 2.
    snr: signal to noise ratio. 
    min_prominence_ratio: require ratio of prominence relative to peak height.
    wlen: impacts the peak detection window. Peak boundaries should be re-examined in noisy tracks.

    Return list of peaks in JSON format, e.g. [{ 'id_number': 0, 'mz', 'apex', 'left_base', 'right_base', 
                                                'height', 'parent_masstrace_id', 'rtime', 'peak_area',
