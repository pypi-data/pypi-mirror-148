    Calculating the ipmitool `-N` and `-R` arguments from ironic.conf [ipmi]
    `command_retry_timeout` and `min_command_interval` now takes into account the
    1 second interval increment that ipmitool adds on each retry event.

    Failure-path ipmitool run duration will now be just less than
    `command_retry_timeout` instead of much longer.
