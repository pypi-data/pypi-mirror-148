    Fixes redfish firmware update for ilo5 based hardware by
    making necessary changes to check whether sushy_task.messages
    is present, since in case of iLo task data does not contain
    messages attribute. Also it was not calling prepare_ramdisk()
    before rebooting the system to update the firmware which has
    been fixed in this patch.
