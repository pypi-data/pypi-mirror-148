## Bitmap fonts
Bitmap fonts are useful in generating text messages in OpenGL contexts. This utility allows to 
convert a TTF font file into a bitmap font.

## Description
create-font-textture script should be self-explanatory.

## Installation
Within a particular ecosystem, there may be a common way of installing things, such as using Yarn, NuGet, or Homebrew. However, consider the possibility that whoever is reading your README is a novice and would like more guidance. Listing specific steps helps remove ambiguity and gets people to using your project as quickly as possible. If it only runs in a specific context like a particular programming language version or operating system or has dependencies that have to be installed manually, also add a Requirements subsection.
