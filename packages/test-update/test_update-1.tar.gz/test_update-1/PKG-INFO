Description: This package analyzes the style of a given writing sample using "involved" and "informational" linguistic features. The main objective of "involved" features is to build a relationship with a reader, engage or involve a reader in a text, and they include pronouns, non-phrasal coordination ("and"), and questions. The main objective of "informational" features is to convey facts and draw attention to the factual information in a text rather than build a relationship with a reader, and they include determiners (such as "the", "which", "both", etc.), past tense verbs, and numbers. The package calculates the number of "involved" and "informational" features and prints out an "involved-informational ratio". The higher the "involved-informational ratio", the more "involved" a given writing sample. These linguistic features are based on the work of Biber (1988), Argamon et al. (2003), Pennebaker (2011).
