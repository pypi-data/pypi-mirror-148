        Notes:
            - A previous version relied on `Path.with_stem`, which requires Python 3.9. In the
            present version, the non existing sibling does not conserve the extension of the
            original file.
            - Truncated SHA-256 and BASE-64 were considered, but the former is overkill, and the
            character set of the latter is not appropriate for filenames.

        2. `path` is in the file system,
        3. and `new_path` is not in the file system yet.

        Results:
            - `path` is replaced by `new_path` in the file system.
            - Any descendant of `path` is replaced by the appropriate `path`.

        Notes:
            - The renaming is virtual only. The ultimate goal is to produce a sequence of "safe"
                clauses (namely, arcs) for an ulterior actual renaming.
                Nevertheless, all the consequences of a renaming (specifically, of a folder) are
                simulated to ensure testability.
            - In a virtual file system, renaming a node before its parent is not mandatory.
