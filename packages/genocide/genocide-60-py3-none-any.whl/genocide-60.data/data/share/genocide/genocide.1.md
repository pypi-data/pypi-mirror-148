# SYNOPSIS
| genocide \<cmd>\ 
| genocide -c

# DESCRIPTION

| GENOCIDE is a python3 program that holds evidence that the king of the
| netherlands is doing a genocide, a written response where the king of
| the netherlands  confirmed taking note of “what i have written”, namely
| proof that medicine he uses in treatement laws like zyprexa, haldol,
| abilify and clozapine are poison. This means that the king of the
| netherlands is not using laws to provide care for the elderly,
| handicapped, psychiatric patients and criminals but is using the laws
| to administer poison. Poison that makes impotent, is both physical
| (contracted muscles) and mental (let people hallucinate) torture and
| kills members of the victim groups.

 
| GENOCIDE shows correspondence with the Internationnal Criminal Court
| about the genocide of the king of the netherlands (using the law to
| administer poison), including stats on suicide while the king of the
| netherland's genocide is still going on. Status is that there is not
| a basis to proceed, whether the king of the netherland's genocide
| doesn’t fit the description or the netherlands doesn’t want to
| cooperate with stopping the genocide the king of the netherlands is
| doing.


| GENOCIDE provides a IRC bot that can run as a background daemon for
| 24/7 a day presence in a IRC channel. You can use it to display RSS
| feeds, act as a UDP to IRC gateway, program your own commands for it
| and have it log objects on disk to search them.


| correspondence is under **EM_T04_OTP-CR-117_19** 
| genocide start is set at **05-10-2018**
