# fastplotlib
A fast plotting library built using the `pygfx` render engine that can use [Vulkan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vulkan), so it is very fast!

Checkout pygfx!
https://github.com/pygfx/pygfx

`fastplotlib` is very experimental but you're welcome to try it out or contribute!

# Installation

You will need a GPU that supports Vulkan (iGPUs in CPUs should be fine). 
Generally if your GPU is from 2017 or later it should support Vulkan.

## Install Vulkan drivers

For more information see: https://github.com/pygfx/wgpu-py#platform-requirements

### Windows:
Apparently Vulkan should be installed by default on Windows 11.

### Linux:
Debian based distros:

```bash
sudo apt install mesa-vulkan-drivers
```

For other distros use Google to find the appropriate vulkan driver package

### Mac OSX:
You will need at least MacOSX v10.13
 

```commandline
pip install https://github.com/kushalkolar/fastplotlib.git
```
